# ðŸ§® RSigma 
Mixes **"Rust"** and the Greek letter **Sigma (âˆ‘)**, often associated with summation/spreadsheets. Feels like something you'd expect in a research lab.

## Background & Motivation
**RSigma** is a **lightweight**, **high-performance spreadsheet computation engine** written in **Rust**, designed to explore reactive dataflow, concurrency, and safe system architecture. Inspired by the legacy of early "killer apps" like VisiCalc, RSigma reimagines the spreadsheet not as a GUI-bound tool, but as a **server-controlled**, **reactive data platform** â€” ideal for integration, automation, and scalable computation.

Instead of focusing on traditional UI-driven interactivity, RSigma offers a **command-driven interface** â€” allowing programmatic cell manipulation, dynamic formula updates, and real-time recalculationsâ€”all under a thread-safe, concurrent architecture.
