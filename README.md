# ðŸ§® RSigma 
Mixes **"Rust"** and the Greek letter **Sigma (âˆ‘)**, often associated with summation/spreadsheets. Feels like something you'd expect in a research lab.

## ðŸ“˜ Background & Motivation
**RSigma** is a **lightweight**, **high-performance spreadsheet computation engine** written in **Rust**, designed to explore reactive dataflow, concurrency, and safe system architecture. Inspired by the legacy of early "killer apps" like VisiCalc, RSigma reimagines the spreadsheet not as a GUI-bound tool, but as a **server-controlled**, **reactive data platform** â€” ideal for integration, automation, and scalable computation.

Instead of focusing on traditional UI-driven interactivity, RSigma offers a **command-driven interface** â€” allowing programmatic cell manipulation, dynamic formula updates, and real-time recalculationsâ€”all under a thread-safe, concurrent architecture.

## ðŸ’¡ Why RSigma
**RSigma** is designed to bring a fully featured, multi-threaded spreadsheet manager capable of handling complex dependencies and cell evaluations in real-time. The spreadsheet manager makes it easy to interact with data through commands such as ```get``` and ```set```, and supports advanced features such as:
- **Real-time data updates** via multi-threaded operations, ensuring atomic transactions.
- **Variable and expression handling** for a flexible and dynamic spreadsheet experience.
- **Cell Dependency Management** that efficiently updates dependent cells asynchronously and handles chains of dependencies.

**RSigma** fills the gap for spreadsheet operations that need to handle complex formulae, multiple users, and concurrent calculations, all while providing a robust and scalable architecture suited for real-world applications like collaborative data analysis or task tracking.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
The main goals of RSigma are:
- **Real-Time Interaction** â€“ Ensure that the user can interact with the spreadsheet in real-time, with atomic updates and responses.
- **Concurrency Handling** â€“ Support multiple concurrent users/commands with thread-safe operations while ensuring that each user's session is properly isolated.
- **Formula Evaluation** â€“ Implement a formula language (based on Rhai) that allows for complex calculations and interactions between cells, handling both basic operations and advanced features such as summing ranges.
- **Error Propagation** â€“ Ensure that errors in cell dependencies are managed correctly and reported to users appropriately.
- **Asynchronous Dependency Updates** â€“ Properly handle dependent cells and allow updates to propagate asynchronously while maintaining consistency.

### ðŸ§© Module Breakdown
#### 1. Core Module (```core.rs```)
- Purpose: This module acts as the central hub of the RSigma system. It manages the primary logic of the spreadsheet, including storage of cell values, handling updates, and maintaining the overall state of the spreadsheet.
- Responsibilities:
  - Storing cell data and related metadata.
  - Handling updates when cells are modified or referenced.
  - Managing the consistency of the spreadsheetâ€™s state.

#### 2. Command Handling Module (```commands.rs```)
- Purpose: This module is responsible for parsing and handling commands like get, set, and other spreadsheet-related operations.
